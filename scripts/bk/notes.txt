### notes ###

$ bugs
	- copying directories creates a .backup directory within
		the backup directory itself
		! #cp -r test/ test/.backup
		- #cp -r test/ test.backup/
			- both ways will end up the same (test vs test/)
			- create/overwrite variable 'dir' as the $FILE string
				length -1

$ current
	- want the file to be backed up as an argument
	- multiple files

$ future
	- backup multiple files with a destination
	- create a backup folder in current directory to store
		backups in

$ update log
	- v2.0 ...
	- v1.0 [09/28/2016] : Creation of bk!
